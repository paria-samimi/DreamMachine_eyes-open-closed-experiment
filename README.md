# DreamMachine_eyes-open-closed-experiment
This Matlab code analyzes extracted EEG signals from the DreamMachine Device for the eyes open and closed experiment. Here, we have used Labrecorder software for recording EEG data and triggers.

These codes are written based on fildtrip codes and were adjusted with the output of DreamMachine data.
